# A data terminal for Elecraft radios

- Only K3 and KX3 radios are supported;
- only PSK31, PSK63 and RTTY modes are supported.

This will also provide utility functions to characterize
and pre-tune antenna using miniVNA and my custom made
remote antenna tuner.

## Runtime requirements

- Java 8 with JavaFX 2 support

## Development hints

- If your Scene builder (Gluon) eats too much memory, start it with -Dprism.order=sw
